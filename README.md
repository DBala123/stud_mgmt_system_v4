### About repository
This repository consists of python code and SQL for implementing a student management system which allows the user to add student records (ID, name, subject, mobile), edit, or delete them. It accesses a MySQL database called "school". I created it with the help of the online course Udemy course "Python Megacourse: Learn Python in 60 Days, Build 20 Apps", in which this app was app no. 14. I wanted to create it to further practise working with Object Oriented Programming and SQL.

### How to clone it and make it work properly
Please note that "main.py" is the main file. In it, I have replaced the password to my personal MySQL with ###. Hence, as the cloner, you'd have to input your own password assuming you already have MySQL installed.
